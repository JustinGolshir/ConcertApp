# ConcertApp
ConcertApp is an AJAX/API based application that utilizes BandsInTown and Google maps. It provides a map button that shows venue locations dynamically coded into the page based on BandsInTown's lat/long venue response, and provides external links to buy tickets. The UI design of the site utilizes Materialize as its CSS framework.
